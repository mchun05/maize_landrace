<h4>Important Data Processing Information</h4>

<p>The data used to generate the venn diagrams below is a subset of the CIMMYT Germplasm Bank
Maize Landrace Accessions. The venn diagrams displays proportions of variants (SNPs/SNVs) that
are shared between all three groups (central overlap area), shared between only two groups, or 
are only found in one of the three populations. We removed  any samples that did
not have landrace data, as well as samples belonging to landraces that had less
than 15 total samples (for statitstical robusticity further down the line). We performed linkage
disequilibrium (LD) pruning as well as ran the data through a global minor allele frequency 
(MAF) filter that removed any variants with an average MAF that fell below 0.05%</p>
