<h4>Important Data Processing Information</h4>

<p>The data used to generate the venn diagrams below is a subset of the CIMMYT Germplasm Bank
Maize Landrace Accessions. The venn diagrams displays proportions of variants (SNPs/SNVs) that
are shared between all three groups (central overlap area), shared between only two groups, or 
are only found in one of the three populations. As the global minor allele frequency (MAF) 
threshold increases, we observe increasingly more shared variants between landraces and less unique
ones.</p>
